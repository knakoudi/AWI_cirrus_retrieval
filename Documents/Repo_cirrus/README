The AWI*_cirrus_retrieval project has been developed for deriving the geometrical and optical properties of cirrus clouds. The algoritms are applicable to lidar data. The project consists of three matlab routines:
- cirrus_detection.m
- config_constrained_Klett.m
- constrained_Klett.m

The algorithms may need to be modified according to your needs and lidar system specifications (e.g. vertical resolution)

The content of matlab functions needs to be uncommented. The input and output parameters of each function are described in detail within each matlab routine.  

In case of any questions regarding the algorithms, please send us an e-mail at christoph.ritter@awi.de or konstantina.nakoudi@awi.de.

If you wish to apply the algorithm on data from your lidar site, we will be happy to know about the outcome.
